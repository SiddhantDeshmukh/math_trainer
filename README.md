# Maths Trainer

Just a simple maths trainer I use for drilling. Pass in arg `-t` for only
multiplication problems, and/or `-d` to activate death mode (up to 2 decimal
places). Edit the script to change the number of decimal places used in death
mode. 

It's just a python script, uses eval so don't hack yourself pls.
